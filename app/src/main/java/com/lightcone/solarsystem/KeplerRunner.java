               /* The equations we are solving for Kepler's laws define elliptical motion for a planet,
            comet, or asteroid about the Sun at one focus of the ellipse.  But the objects in the
            Solar System generally have different orientations for the long axis of the ellipse, so
            to plot the correct relative orientation of different elliptical orbits on the same plot we
            must rotate each solution by a specific amount (given in the array orientDeg[]).
            This rotation can be implemented in one of two ways.  (1) We can define
            our own 2-dimensional rotation matrix and use it to rotate the coordinates for
            the instantaneous position of each planet, and the shape defining its orbit, before
            plotting it.  (2) We can use the translate(dx, dy) and rotate(angle) methods of the
            Canvas class to transform the canvas appropriately for each object before plotting it.
            Both approaches are complicated by the fact that the origin of the computer graphics
            coordinate system is at the upper left corner, but we are executing elliptical motion
            about a point at the center of the screen, so these transformation involve both
            translations and rotations.  In the following example we employ the 2nd approach and
            use the rotate and translate methods of Canvas to rotate orbits. Notice also that
            we are adopting the fiction that all bodies being considered have the same plane for
            their ellipses.  Except for Pluto and Comet Halley, this is almost true for the objects
            considered here.  Pluto's orbit is tilted about 17 degrees out of the plane of the ecliptic
            (plane defined by the Earth's orbit), Halley's orbit by about 70 degrees, and Mercury's
            orbit by 7 degrees.  All others are within several degrees of the ecliptic plane.  Thus,
            the model in this example is an idealized but almost correct one where the realistic
            elliptical orbits have been tilted when necessary to coincide with the ecliptic plane,
            but their relative orientations within the ecliptic plane are approximately correct.
            To treat the orbits more correctly we need 3D graphics.*/
